\lettrineabstract{Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at HBCU University brings challenges while lifting up expectations in participants. The approaching model is located in the heart of hands-on application on algorithms, datasets, and computer power. Florida A\&M University starts an REU program in Data Science intending to advocate and mentor minority populations in the era of Machine Learning and AI. This experience involves an interdisciplinary group of undergraduate students from different majors such as; Computer Science and Information Technology,  Biology Pre-Medicine, Mathematics, Software Engineer, Pharmacy, Biology Pre-Dental, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Biology, Mathematical Sciences. At the end of the program, the students could integrate AI, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to provide real solutions to their research projects in their area. For example, Time Series Analysis of Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency, Analyzing the Advantages and Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence for Breast Cancer Detection in Women, Analysis of Autism in three different cities using AI, among others projects, which were leverage into students' GitHub Repositories. The students who participated in the REU indicated that this was very important and useful for their careers.  They reported significant enhancement of essential cognitive and personal skills, among the enumerable learned skills, can be mention python programming, skit-learn packets to build machine learning models, the use of Git & Github as version control system collaborating work.}

\section{What is an REU Data Science Research Group? }

REU in Data Science is an experience which faculty, speakers and undergraduate students enjoy an environment designed to learn by doing.  \citep{Reference1}. Most universities and colleges offer their science majors the opportunity to gain some sort of research experience\citep{Reference1,Reference2}. However, Data Science offers a hands on approach to any student that wants to experiment with data, algorithms and programming. Over a one-year project period, Florida A\&M University start a computational data science program that offers courses like python, R and machine learning across campus.  The Data science REU students have diverse backgrounds and experiences and major in different fields. Gender population in Figure \ref{gender}. Major distribution vs GPA in Figure \ref{major}.

We advertised our REU Data Science Site program via a variety of channels including email distributions to targeted institutions, a variety of list serves, and personal contacts. In the first recent month 2021 program, we received 30 applications from across the alliance in Florida, among which 23 were complete with all required documents, including the application form, purpose statement, resume, unofficial transcript, and two letters of references. Based on a comprehensive rubric, the 23 applicants were selected to participate in our Summer 2021 program.

We have the first REU in Data Science at Florida A\&M University, which excels the expectations of students and audience. The modality of learning is project based with the student centric approach. We delivered recorded lectures, speakers from Microsoft, Indiana University and engaging activities to boost students curiosity. Students share their curiosity through the ability to find their own societal problems that required responsible AI and ML. Public datasets was showing to the students but that do not stop the desire to collect their own data. REU Data Science students participate in a mix of activities particularly designed to improve their curiosity with an inductive research (i.e., find patterns in data to target hypothesis questions). We have a teamwork and communication skills through the benefits of new technology. Table I shows the overall schedule of the 8-week summer activities of the REU Site program, which are described in the following subsection.

\subsection{REU Data Science Research Group Components}

We conducted an orientation to introduce the REU data science program activities and all faculty, staff, and graduate students involved.
Particularly, we conveyed what the REU data science was designed to students who were expected to accomplish a project by the end of the 8-week program.

Table 2 summarizes the Data Science Research Group Components(DSRG's) and the benefits of incorporating those components from industry, faculty mentor and students perspectives.


Speakers: We have a total of 6 speakers during the first month, which contextualized with industry the topics we taught. speakers from Microsoft emphasized the importance to find local problems with local data. We as a data scientists we assume the need of data that is not available for us. However, data have to come with a real world problem. Some examples of courses should be taught in academia are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data Prep 
	\item Cloud Computing 
	\item Python and R for Data Science
\end{itemize}


\section{REU students' Projects}

REU Data Science Research Projects: We have each student providing a research topic and data based on their majors. Each REU student is mentored by a faculty mentor and a graduate student. Some interesting projects are:


\subsection{Time Series Analysis of Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency Price Changes}
This project applies neural networks and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to historical records of high-risk cryptocurrency coins to train a prediction model that guesses their price.

\section{REU Data Science Research Group as a Transformative Experience}


Research projects are the key component of our first REU in data science. We provide REU students a fair research experience, we have designed the research projects that students can select their data and problem with common intellectual focus on self-motivation in Data Science education. Transformative experience in Data Science explains weaknesses in many digital transformation strategy efforts and how data can address the problem a certain level. Students report their weaknesses with a tutorial they explain in class and share with peers.
