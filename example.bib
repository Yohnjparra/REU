	Abstract = {Fifteen years ago, a record of research went a long way toward boosting a grad-student prospect to the top of the grad-school application pile, says Marty Ligare, a professor in the physics department at Bucknell. But these days, undergraduates participate in research all the time; in chemistry, 72\% of graduates had some research experience, according to a recent study sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF)},

	Abstract = {Undergraduate research is one of the best
    practices to improve student learning and has a positive lasting
    impact on students' career choices and success. Extensive
    literature review shows that the vast majority of undergraduate
    research programs focus on Science, Technology, Engineering,
    and Mathematics (STEM) disciplinary research. This work-inprogress paper presents a new Research Experiences for
    Undergraduates (REU) Site program that focuses on STEM
    education research rather than STEM disciplinary research.
    This work-in-progress paper describes the overall framework of
    our REU Site program, student recruitment and selection in our
    most recent Summer 2015 program, and four REU research
    projects that share a common intellectual focus on self-regulated
    learning in engineering education. Representative comments
    from undergraduate student participants are provided to
    demonstrate the positive impact of this REU Site program.},

	Abstract = {We present a review of the use of diode lasers in atomic physics with an extensive list of references. We discuss the relevant characteristics of diode lasers and explain how to purchase and use them. We also review the various techniques that have been used to control and narrow the spectral outputs of diode lasers. Finally we present a number of examples illustrating the use of diode lasers in atomic physics experiments. Review of Scientific Instruments is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.},
